  In this study, I tried to implement a DNN that detects and classify pediatric brain tumors using MRI imaging.





# Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most common imaging technique used to detect abnormal brain tumors. Traditionally, MRI images are analyzed manually by radiologists to detect the abnormal conditions in the brain. Manual interpretation of huge volumes of images is time consuming and difficult. Hence, computer-based detection helps in accurate and fast diagnosis. In this study, we proposed an approach that uses deep transfer learning to automatically classify normal and abnormal brain MR images.

# Results
In this study, we have employed a popular pre-trained deep learning CNN architecture (VGG16) to classify normal and abnormal brain MR images. We have obtained better performance than the rest of the techniques obtained using the same dataset. Our developed model can be used to find other brain abnormalities like Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and autism.
